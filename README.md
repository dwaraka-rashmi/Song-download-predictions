# Project evaluation

For project evaluation we will look at your **reports** and **source code**, and we will run your **models** on some input data.

**Fork** this repository and insert the following files in these locations:
   
   - your **model** as `projects/model-student1_student2_student3.jar`
   - your **report** as `reports/report-student1_student2_student3.pdf`
   - your **source code** as a directory in `sources/student1_student2_student3/`
    
You can check whether the model executes by executing `make run`. (The input and output data are gibberish, so don't worry about the accuracy here.)

**Finally you must make a push request** for me to include your changes in the main repo.
